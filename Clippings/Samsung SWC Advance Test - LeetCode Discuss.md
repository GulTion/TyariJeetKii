##### Samsung SWC Advance Test
- Final Year Undergrad at Tier 1/2 Engineering College
- Did 2 months internship at Samsung Bangalore (ON-Campus)
- Cleared SWC advance test as well as Received PPO.

General Format of exam

- No of questions and duration : 1 coding question in 3 hour.
- Languages Allowed : C/C++/Java/Python
- No of Testcases : 10 or 50 ( You have to pass all the testcase in order to clear the test)
- No of attempts : 5 or 10.
- Favourite Topics : Backtracking/ Permutation & Combinations / Graphs / DP

**Note** : Mostly in all questions libraries are allowed.

Samsung generally asks from previous year questions. So Please Please make sure you practice well all the previous year questions with best possible time and space complexity. While practice try to optimise your backtracking/bruteforce solution.

I'm attaching some links for previous year questions and practice. Make sure you able to achieve the optimised version of bruteforce solution if possible in that question.

If you have any doubts do ask in comments.




> [!NOTE] Comment
> Yes post internship there will be SWC pro test for full time, 4 hour exam same pattern but harder than advance in which you have to pass 50 tc(fixed). In test you'll get 25 tc and you have to pass them all and in background they run 25 tc so total 50 tc. Please note you have to write most optimized code to pass this exam. And background tc are generally large ie requires more time of execution. As you already got an offer you can practice for SWC pro on internal platform.
