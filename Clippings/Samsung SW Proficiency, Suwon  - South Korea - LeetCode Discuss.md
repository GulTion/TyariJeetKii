I had a SW proficiency test at Samsung Electronics on 16th Oct 2022 and test was really difficult and it was extremely difficult to pass the test. I have completed my master's degree in AI and appeared in test for R & D position.

Questions: 2  
Duration: 4 hours

1st Question: The first problem related to warehouse problem where the items are stacked into groups and you have to do write a code for `forwarding, senditem, erase,broken` functions and i did not remeber the name of function. I am unable to find the problem on the internet. **Does anyone have an idea?**

2nd Question: The seond problem related to Galdiator problem, where we have to make `size, position,points and levels` functions. These both problem are very hard and i cannot not find. **Does anyone find on the internet?**
