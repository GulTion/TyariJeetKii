I am sharing my experience with Samsung Semiconductor India Research.

**Round 1**

consists of 3 coding questions in 90 minutes. The level of difficulty ranges from easy to medium.

**Round 2**

Technical Round: This was a 1-hour round. It started with a basic introduction and then moved to some OS core concept questions. We had a detailed discussion about my project, and then he asked me about system design concepts that could be implemented in my project. After that, he gave me a BST question about insertion and search and asked me to write a full-fledged code for it. He also gave me some test cases to validate my code. And last, he asked me to write a pseudo code regarding the deletion of a node and its various cases.

**Round 3**

Tech + Managerial Round: After Round 1, I got a call for Round 2. He was a very experienced person. He gave me a scenario-based question to check my logical ability, and the discussion went on till he was satisfied. I can't tell you the exact questions, but they were about a space optimization problem involving matrices and how we could effectively create a program to store faulty addresses using a non-primitive data structure. He also gave a question on Binary Search, which was like you are given an array of 0 and 1 sorted and need to find a translation point (a point where 0 ends and 1 starts). He was very friendly and helped me at every step, wherever I was struck. This round lasted approximately 80 minutes.

**Round 4**

HR Round:- After Round 3, I got a call for HR round. We had a discussion about salary and the different components involved, and also about the role.

**Final Verdict: Selected**
