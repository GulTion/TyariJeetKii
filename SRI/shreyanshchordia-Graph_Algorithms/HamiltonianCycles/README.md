# Hamiltonian Cycles

You can research about hamiltonian cycles on the internet if you don't have a clue about it. 

In simple words, a Hamiltonian Cycle is a cycle (compulsorily returns back to the starting point, being a cycle) in a graph G such that it 
passes through all the V vertices of the graph exactly once.

### Problem statement : 
To print all the hamiltonian cycles for a given graph G, along with the count of the cycles found.

In simple words,
1. Starting from any point in the graph.

2. Returning back to the same point after passing through all vertices.

3. No vertex must be traversed more than once.

4. Printing all such possible cycles in the graph and also outputting the final count of the number of cycles ound.
