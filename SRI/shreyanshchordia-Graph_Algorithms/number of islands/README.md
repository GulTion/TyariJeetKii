This Problem is medium level graph algorithm implementation problem.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

Given a Matrix consisting of 0s and 1s. Find the number of islands of connected 1s present in the matrix. 
Note: A 1 is said to be connected if it has another 1 around it (either of the 8 directions).

**Input:**
The first line of input will be the number of testcases **T**, then T test cases follow. The first line of each testcase contains two space separated integers N and M. Then in the next line are the NxM inputs of the matrix A separated by space .

**Output**:
For each testcase in a new line, print the number of islands present.

**Expected Time Complexity: O(N*M).\
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N*M).**

**Constraints:\
1 <= T <= 100\
1 <= N, M <= 100\
0 <= A[i][j] <= 1**

**Example :\
Input**

2\
3 3\
1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1\
4 4\
1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0

**Output**\
2\
2

**Explanation:**

Testcase 1: The graph will look like\
**1 1** 0\
0 0 **1**\
*1* 0 **1**\
Here, two islands will be formed
First island will be formed by elements **{A[0][0] ,  A[0][1], A[1][2], A[2][2]}**
Second island will be formed by *{A[2][0]}*.

Testcase 2: The graph will look like\
**1 1** 0 0\
0 0 **1** 0\
0 0 0 **1**\
0 *1* 0 0\
Here, two islands will be formed
First island will be formed by elements **{A[0][0] ,  A[0][1], A[1][2], A[2][3]}**
Second island will be formed by *{A[3][1]}*.
