Of course! I'd be happy to guide you through solving this problem. This is a great problem for practicing how to analyze a complex process and find an efficient, elegant solution, which is a key skill in competitive programming.

Let's break it down step-by-step.

### 1. Understanding the Problem Statement

First, let's dissect the drawing process. It's not a standard tree traversal like BFS or DFS. It's a custom algorithm, so we must pay close attention to its specific rules.

*   **Initial State:** We start with only vertex 1 drawn. All other vertices are "undrawn".
*   **The "Reading" Step (Step 1):** This is the core of the process. In a single reading, we iterate through *all* `n-1` edges *in the given input order*. For each edge `(u, v)`, if one endpoint is drawn and the other isn't, we draw the undrawn one.
*   **The Loop (Step 2):** We repeat the "Reading" step until all vertices are drawn.
*   **The Goal:** We need to find the total number of times we perform the "Reading" step.

Let's trace the first example to solidify our understanding:
*   `n = 6`
*   Edges in order: `(4, 5)`, `(1, 3)`, `(1, 2)`, `(3, 4)`, `(1, 6)`

**Initial State:**
*   Drawn vertices: `{1}`
*   Readings done: 0

**Reading 1:**
We start an iteration over the edges. Let's keep track of the set of drawn vertices, which expands *during* this reading.
*   Initially for this reading, `Drawn = {1}`.
1.  Edge `(4, 5)`: Both `4` and `5` are undrawn. Nothing happens.
2.  Edge `(1, 3)`: `1` is drawn, `3` is undrawn. **Draw vertex 3.** Now `Drawn = {1, 3}`.
3.  Edge `(1, 2)`: `1` is drawn, `2` is undrawn. **Draw vertex 2.** Now `Drawn = {1, 2, 3}`.
4.  Edge `(3, 4)`: `3` is now drawn (from step 2 of this reading!), `4` is undrawn. **Draw vertex 4.** Now `Drawn = {1, 2, 3, 4}`.
5.  Edge `(1, 6)`: `1` is drawn, `6` is undrawn. **Draw vertex 6.** Now `Drawn = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}`.

**End of Reading 1:**
*   We have drawn vertices `{1, 2, 3, 4, 6}`.
*   Vertex `5` is still undrawn. Since not all vertices are drawn, we must perform another reading.
*   Total readings so far: 1.

**Reading 2:**
*   The set of vertices drawn *before* this reading is `{1, 2, 3, 4, 6}`.
1.  Edge `(4, 5)`: `4` is drawn, `5` is undrawn. **Draw vertex 5.** Now all vertices are drawn.
2.  Edge `(1, 3)`: Both drawn. Nothing.
3.  ... and so on.

**End of Reading 2:**
*   All vertices are drawn. The algorithm terminates.
*   The total number of readings performed is **2**.

**Crucial Observation:** A vertex can be drawn in the same reading as its neighbor. For example, in Reading 1, vertex 3 was drawn, and later in that same reading, its neighbor 4 was also drawn. This happens because the edge `(3, 4)` appeared in the input list *after* the edge `(1, 3)` that caused 3 to be drawn. This dependency on edge order is the key.

### 2. Brainstorming Approaches

#### Approach 1: Direct Simulation (The Naive Way)

The most straightforward approach is to just implement the process as described.

*   Maintain a boolean array `is_drawn[1...n]`. Initialize `is_drawn[1] = true`.
*   Use a counter for drawn vertices, `drawn_count = 1`.
*   Use a counter for readings, `readings = 0`.
*   Start a `while (drawn_count < n)` loop.
    *   Inside the loop, increment `readings`.
    *   Create a variable `newly_drawn_this_reading = 0`.
    *   Iterate through the `n-1` edges in the given order.
        *   For an edge `(u, v)`: if `is_drawn[u] != is_drawn[v]`, and one of them *is* drawn, find the undrawn one and mark it as drawn. Increment `newly_drawn_this_reading`.
    *   If `newly_drawn_this_reading == 0`, break (this means we are stuck, which shouldn't happen in a tree).
    *   Update `drawn_count`.
*   The final answer is `readings`.

**Complexity Analysis:**
The `while` loop runs for `R` readings. In the worst case, we might only draw one new vertex per reading, making `R` potentially `O(n)`. Inside the loop, we iterate over `n-1` edges.
This leads to a time complexity of `O(R * n)`, which could be `O(n^2)` in the worst case. Given `n` up to `2 * 10^5`, `n^2` is around $4 * 10^{10}$, far too slow. We need a more efficient way.

#### Approach 2: Thinking in terms of Dependencies (The Efficient Way)

The `O(n^2)` simulation is too slow. This usually means we're re-computing things or missing a structural property. Let's analyze the condition for when a vertex gets drawn.

Let's define `depth[v]` as the number of readings required to draw vertex `v`. Our final answer is the maximum `depth[v]` over all `v`.
*   By definition, vertex 1 is drawn before any readings. We can say `depth[1] = 1` (it's "ready" for the 1st reading).

Now, consider any other vertex `v`. Let `p` be its parent in the tree when rooted at 1. `v` can only be drawn after `p` is drawn.
*   Let the edge connecting `p` to `v` be `e_{pv}`, which is the `i_{pv}`-th edge in the input list.
*   Let `p` be drawn in reading `depth[p]`.
*   `v` will be drawn in either reading `depth[p]` or `depth[p] + 1`. When does each case happen?

Let's trace the "wave" of drawing. In reading `k`, a set of vertices are drawn.
Suppose `p` is drawn because of its parent `g` (grandparent of `v`). Let the edge `(g, p)` be `e_{gp}`, with input index `i_{gp}`.

*   **Case 1: `v` is drawn in the same reading as `p` (`depth[v] = depth[p]`).**
    This can only happen if, during reading `depth[p]`, vertex `p` gets drawn, and *then* the algorithm processes the edge `e_{pv}`. This means the event "draw `p`" must happen before the event "check edge `e_{pv}`". The event "draw `p`" is triggered by edge `e_{gp}`. Therefore, we must have `i_{gp} < i_{pv}`.

*   **Case 2: `v` is drawn in the reading after `p` (`depth[v] = depth[p] + 1`).**
    This happens if we cannot draw `v` in the same reading as `p`. This occurs when we process edge `e_{pv}` (with index `i_{pv}`), but `p` hasn't been drawn *yet in this reading*. This happens if the edge `e_{gp}` that draws `p` has an index `i_{gp}` which is *greater* than `i_{pv}`. So, by the time we check `e_{pv}`, `p` is still considered "undrawn" for this round. `v` has to wait for the next reading, when `p` is already in the "drawn" set from the start.

This gives us a beautiful recurrence relation!

Let `depth[u]` be the reading number when `u` is drawn.
Let `parent_edge_idx[u]` be the input index of the edge connecting `u` to its parent.

*   `depth[1] = 1`. `parent_edge_idx[1] = 0` (a base case, since it has no parent).
*   For any other node `v` with parent `p`:
    *   If `parent_edge_idx[v] < parent_edge_idx[p]`: `depth[v] = depth[p] + 1`
    *   If `parent_edge_idx[v] > parent_edge_idx[p]`: `depth[v] = depth[p]`

This is a property we can compute for every node if we traverse the tree from the root. A Depth First Search (DFS) is perfect for this.

### 3. The Algorithm and Implementation Plan

1.  **Preprocessing:** We need to know the tree structure and the index of each edge.
    *   We'll build an adjacency list where for each vertex `u`, we store a list of its neighbors. Critically, with each neighbor `v`, we'll also store the 1-based index of the edge `(u, v)` from the input.
    *   `vector<pair<int, int>> adj[n + 1];`
    *   When reading the `i`-th edge `(u, v)` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`):
        *   `adj[u].push_back({v, i});`
        *   `adj[v].push_back({u, i});`

2.  **Traversal:** We'll perform a single DFS from the root (vertex 1).
    *   We'll have a function, say, `calculate_depths(u, p, u_depth, p_edge_idx)`.
        *   `u`: current vertex
        *   `p`: parent of `u`
        *   `u_depth`: the calculated depth for `u`
        *   `p_edge_idx`: the index of the edge that connected `p` to *its* parent.
    *   The initial call will be `calculate_depths(1, 0, 1, 0)`. (Parent of 1 is 0, depth is 1, parent edge index is 0).

3.  **DFS Logic:** Inside `calculate_depths(u, p, u_depth, p_edge_idx)`:
    *   Update the maximum depth found so far: `max_depth = max(max_depth, u_depth)`.
    *   Iterate through all neighbors of `u`. Let a neighbor be `v` connected by an edge with index `v_edge_idx`.
    *   If `v` is the parent `p`, ignore it.
    *   Otherwise, `v` is a child. Calculate its depth `v_depth`:
        *   If `v_edge_idx < p_edge_idx`, then `v_depth = u_depth + 1`.
        *   Else, `v_depth = u_depth`.
    *   Recursively call `calculate_depths(v, u, v_depth, v_edge_idx)`.

4.  **Final Result:** After the DFS completes, `max_depth` will hold the answer.

**Complexity Analysis of the DFS approach:**
*   Building the adjacency list takes `O(n)` time.
*   The DFS visits each vertex and each edge exactly once. For a tree, this is `O(V + E) = O(n + n-1) = O(n)`.
*   Finding the max depth is done during the DFS.
*   Total Time Complexity: **O(n)** per test case.
*   Space Complexity: **O(n)** for the adjacency list and recursion stack.

This is highly efficient and will pass within the time limits.

### 4. C++ Implementation

Here is a clean and well-structured implementation of the DFS approach.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Adjacency list to store pairs of {neighbor, edge_index}
vector<pair<int, int>> adj[200005];
int max_readings;

// DFS to calculate the number of readings for each node
void dfs(int u, int p, int current_readings, int parent_edge_idx) {
    // Update the overall maximum readings needed
    max_readings = max(max_readings, current_readings);

    // Iterate over all neighbors of the current vertex u
    for (auto& edge : adj[u]) {
        int v = edge.first;
        int edge_idx = edge.second;

        // Skip the parent node
        if (v == p) {
            continue;
        }

        // Apply the recurrence relation to find the readings for the child v
        int child_readings = current_readings;
        if (edge_idx < parent_edge_idx) {
            child_readings++;
        }

        // Recurse for the child node
        dfs(v, u, child_readings, edge_idx);
    }
}

void solve() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    // Clear adjacency list for the current test case
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        adj[i].clear();
    }

    // Read edges and build the adjacency list
    // The i-th edge read has index i
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        int u, v;
        cin >> u >> v;
        adj[u].push_back({v, i});
        adj[v].push_back({u, i});
    }

    // Reset max_readings for the current test case
    max_readings = 0;

    // Start DFS from vertex 1.
    // dfs(u, parent, current_readings, parent_edge_index)
    // For the root (vertex 1):
    // - parent is 0 (or any invalid node)
    // - it's available in reading 1
    // - its parent's edge index is 0 (base case)
    dfs(1, 0, 1, 0);

    cout << max_readings << endl;
}

int main() {
    // Fast I/O
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        solve();
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Summary of the Method

1.  **Analyze the Process:** We understood that the drawing order depends on the input order of edges.
2.  **Identify Inefficiency:** A direct simulation is too slow (`O(n^2)`). This prompts us to look for a more direct calculation.
3.  **Find the Recurrence:** The key insight is that the reading number for a child node `v` depends on its parent `p`'s reading number and the relative order of the edge `(p,v)` and the edge that drew `p`.
4.  **Develop an Efficient Algorithm:** This recurrence can be solved for all nodes in one `O(n)` pass using a DFS traversal starting from the root (vertex 1).
5.  **Implement Cleanly:** The C++ code reflects this logic, using an adjacency list with edge indices and a recursive DFS function to compute the result.

This problem is a fantastic example of how a seemingly complex iterative process can often be simplified into a single-pass traversal once you identify the underlying dependency structure. Keep practicing this way of thinking, and you'll get faster at spotting these patterns
