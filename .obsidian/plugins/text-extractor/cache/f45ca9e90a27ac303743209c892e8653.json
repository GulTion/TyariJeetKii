Some, maybe none or all, of its digits have in its place. You need to replace each of the with any digits to to form the ﬁnal integer. All the does not require being replaced by the same digit, but you may use the same digit multiple times as replacement. Find the ﬁnal integer that has the most set bits (number of 's) in its binary representation. If there are many such options, output the largest possible integer. Note that the ﬁnal integer may have leading zeros. But you must output without the leading zeros. Input Format The ﬁrst line contains a single integer — the number of test cases. Each test contains a single line with a string representing the integer given to you. It contains only and digits from to . It won't have any leading zeros but may have leading . Constraints Output Format For each test case, output the ﬁnal integer in separate lines. If there are many such options, output the largest possible integer. The output must not contain any leading zeros.
