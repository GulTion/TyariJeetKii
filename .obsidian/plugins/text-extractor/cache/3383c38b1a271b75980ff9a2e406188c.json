This week one of the engineers in SRBD became sick and he needs help to solve the problem assigned to him. As other engineers have their own problems to solve, would you help him? If you are interested let's hear out the problem. SRBD is going to arrange a chess tournament next month. They collected the online ratings of the registered players already.
