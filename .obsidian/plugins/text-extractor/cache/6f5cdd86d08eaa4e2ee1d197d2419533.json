You should create algorithm to print out total placement conﬁguration of items on the board with restrictions as follow: 1. There is no more than one item in board for each row. 2. There is no more than one item in board for each column. 3. There is no more than one item in all diagonal of that item. 4. Every item is diﬀerent (you can imagine that every item has its own number). Constraint 3 ≤ N ≤ 7 Input Format First line contains , the row number and column number of board. Output Format Print maximum conﬁguration number of items placement on the board. Sample Input 4 Sample Output 48 Explanation For this explanation, I use N = 3 as sample input. For N = 3, we can dr aw the board as follow: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 If you put item in cell 3, you can 't put any item on cell 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 (describe as follo w) X X _ $ X X X X _ So for n = 3, total conﬁgur ation is 0. Let me explain about every item is diﬀerent.  Interview Prep | Blog | Scoring | Environment | FAQ | About Us | Support | Careers | Terms Of Service | Privacy Policy | X X I2 I1 X X X X X Conﬁguration above is diﬀerent with conﬁguration as below: X X I1 I2 X X X X X eventhough both of conﬁguration is in the same position.
