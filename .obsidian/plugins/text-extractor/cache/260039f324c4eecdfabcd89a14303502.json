To be a king you have to pass the test. The test is to count number of ways to express as a sum of diﬀerent primes. Here, two ways are considered to be the same if they sum up the same set of the primes. For example, 8 can be e xpressed as 3 + 5 and 5 + 3 but the y are not distinguished. Now ﬁnish the test to be a King in Prime Village ! Input Format First line will contains , and . Constraint: 1 ≤ ≤ 1120 1 ≤ ≤ 14 Output Format Print out number of ways to express as a sum of diﬀerent primes. You may assume the output will be less than 2 Sample Input 24 3 Sample Output 2 Explanation There are two ways to express 24 as 3 diﬀer ent primes : 1. 2 + 3 + 19 = 24 2. 2 + 5 + 17 = 24 Submissions: 12 Max Score: 100 Diﬃculty: Medium Rate This Challenge: More 31          ⚙C   #include <stdio.h> #include <string.h> #include <math.h> #include <stdlib.h> int main() { 1 ▾ 23456 ▾ 7 Interview Prep | Blog | Scoring | Environment | FAQ | About Us | Support | Careers | Terms Of Service | Privacy Policy | Test against custom input Line: 1 Col: 1 Run Code Submit CodeUpload Code as File    /* Enter your code here.
