They're staying near a forest where they come across a bunch of trees. Her brother notices some trees are standing on a straight line and comes up with the following problem. There are trees situated on an inﬁnite line. You intend to cut all the trees. The tree is located at an integer coordinate on the line. It is guaranteed that the trees are located at distinct positions. The height of the tree is a positive integer . You can cut a tree in one of two ways: left or right, which determines the direction the tree will fall towards once it is cut. A tree at position will fall in the space inclusive if it is cut on the right side and will fall in the space inclusive if it is cut on the left side. To properly cut a tree, the space it falls over in must be empty, that is there cannot be any other tree standing there when it is cut. Once a tree has fallen, the space it falls in is cleared afterwards and becomes empty. You can assume there is empty space at every location on the inﬁnite line (possibly negative coordinates) that doesn't have a tree. Let's determine a bordering space , then can cut all the trees in any order and each tree in any way of your choice such that none of the trees fall outside this border. Suppose the length of the bordering space is , what is the minimum you need to do this? Since the siblings solved this quickly, their mother proposed a more diﬃcult calculation. She wants the summation of over all pairs of integers where . Here is the minimum required length of the bordering space if only the trees with indices existed on the inﬁnite line and the remaining space was empty. Seeing her brother get lost in the math, she wants your help to ﬁgure this out fast, so they can go back to enjoying their holidays. Input Format The ﬁrst line contains an integer denoting the number of test cases. Then testcases follow. The ﬁrst line of each test case contains an integer denoting the number of trees in a line. The second line contains integers where the integer denotes the location of the tree. The third line contains integers where the integer denotes the height of the tree. Constraints for all Sum of over all testcases does not exceed Sum of over all testcases does not exceed Output Format  For each testcase print the answer in a separate line. Sample Input 0 2 4 1 7 8 11 1 9 2 3 2 7 9 2 2 Sample Output 0 78 11 Explanation 0 1. First testcase - For bordering space can be in . Cut tree on Right side: Falls in . Cut tree on Left side: Falls in . Cut tree on Right side: Falls in . Cut tree on Left side: Falls in . 2. Second testcase - For bordering space can be in by cutting the & trees in order on the Right.
