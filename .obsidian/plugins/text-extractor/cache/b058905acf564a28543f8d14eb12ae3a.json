There are cities on the planet and and the cities are linked through bidirectional roads. Terminus is a peaceful planet, but recently a group of rebels has hidden bombs at crucial locations. Your mission, as the mayor of Terminus, is to locate these bombs before they detonate. Unfortunately, you don't know the location of the bombs. But you have a list of pair of cities and intel suggests the bombs are located at the middle city of the path between the two given cities. Formally, you have to answer queries of the following type: Given cities and , ﬁnd city such that is minimized. If there are multiple such cities, output the one where is minimized. Note: is deﬁned as the minimum number of edges in the path from node to . Input Format The ﬁrst line of input contains an integer denoting the number of test cases. Then testcases follow. The ﬁrst line of each test case contains an integer — the number of cities. The next lines contains two integers and , denoting that there is a road between cities and . The next line contains an integer — the number of queries. The next lines describe queries. Each line contains two integers and — indicating a bomb is located between city and . Constraints Sum of over all testcases does not exceed Sum of over all testcases does not exceed Output Format For each query, output a single integer denoting the answer for that query.
