We deﬁne the compositeness of an index as the length of the largest subarray such that the below conditions meet: 1. . In other words, the subarray contains the th index. 2. The greatest common divisor of the elements of the subarray is greater than . That is, If no such subarray exists for index , the compositeness of is considered to be . For each index of the given array, ﬁnd its compositeness. Note: A subarray is a contiguous part of an array. For example, , and are subarrays of the array but is not. Input Format The ﬁrst line contains one integer — the length of the array. Next line contains integers — the elements of the array Constraints Output Format Print integers — the of which denotes the compositeness of index . Sample Input 0 7 2 4 6 24 15 3 3 Sample Output 0 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 Explanation 0 For index and , we can choose the subarray . For the rest of the indices, we can choose the subarray .  Interview Prep | Blog | Scoring | Environment | FAQ | About Us | Support | Careers | Terms Of Service | Privacy Policy | Submissions: 195 Max Score: 100 Rate This Challenge: More         Test against custom input  ⚙C  Line: 1 Col: 1 Run Code Submit CodeUpload Code as File #include <stdio.h> #include <string.h> #include <math.h> #include <stdlib.h> int main() {    /* Enter your code here.
