Sauron, the Lord of the Rings, aspired to subjugate all of Middle-earth and mold it according to his will. To aid in his quest for dominion, he forged the One Ring, a weapon of immense power. Before Sauron's might, Aragorn, the king of Gondor, was defeated and forced to abandon his kingdom. Having left his homeland behind, Aragorn discovered a new realm consisting of cities, numbered from to , separated by water. He established the capital of his new kingdom in the city numbered and began assembling his army. Gradually, he would select any two cities randomly and construct a two-way bridge between them if any one of these cities were accessible from the capital as building materials were always supplied from the capital. To save resources, Aragorn refrained from constructing bridges if it was already possible to reach the capital from both the cities. Occasionally, he would wander between cities, searching for signs of enemies. Meanwhile, Sauron remained vigilant, ceaselessly dispatching his Orc forces to these cities with the intent of attacking and annihilating the capital. However, this time, Aragorn possessed the Aetheric Nulliﬁer, an ancient weapon capable of swiftly obliterating all designated bridges. Whenever Aragorn encountered enemies within his kingdom, he would resort to destroying the minimum number of bridges necessary to prevent the enemy from reaching the capital. The battle between Aragorn and Sauron raged on, with each side employing their strategies and weapons. The fate of Middle-earth hung in the balance, as the forces of good and evil clashed in a cataclysmic struggle for supremacy. Aragorn appointed you to build a system that will perform operations of diﬀerent types speciﬁed below: ( ) - Build a bridge between city and city . The bridge shall not be built, if it unveils a path to the capital for the Orc forces sent earlier. ( ) - A list of cities of size is given where Orc forces start their exploration. Find a minimum number of bridges to destroy such that the enemies of these cities can not reach the capital. After that, destroy those bridges using the Aetheric Nulliﬁer. If there are multiple sets of bridges, destroy only them such that a maximum number of cities stay connected with the capital. Having failed in their quest to seize the capital, the Orc forces now occupy these cities, biding their time in the hope of one day to track down Aragorn. ( ) - Find the minimum number of cities Aragorn needs to visit including city if he wishes to travel from city to city . Of course he will not visit a city where the Orc forces those are sent earlier may reach and attack him. Print if it is impossible to reach city from city . Input Format Input starts with an integer denoting test cases. For each test case, input starts with integers , — the total number of cities and the number of operations. Next lines contain operations — one operation per line. Constraints The overall summation of , and is  Output Format For each case, print \"Case #c:\" in a line, where is the test case number. In the next lines, print the output of the queries. For each query of type , print if it is possible to build a bridge otherwise print in a line. For each query of type , print the total number of bridges to be destroyed in a line. For each query of type , print the minimum number of cities Aragorn needs to visit in a line. Follow the samples for the exact output format.
