When a balls reaches an end of the pole, it immediatelly falls of it. When two balls meets they turn back and start moving in opposite directions. You know the original position of balls on the pole, but you do not know the directions in which the balls moving. Your task is to compute the earliest and the latest possible times needed for all balls to fall oﬀ the pole. Input Format First line will contains and . These two numbers are followed by integers giving the position of each balls on the pole as the distance measured from the left end of the pole, in no particular order. Constraints 1 ≤ ≤ 10 1 ≤ ≤ 10 Output Format Output two numbers separated by a single space. The ﬁrst number is the earliest possible time when all balls fall oﬀ the pole (if the dir ections of their moves are chosen appropriately) and the second number is the latest possible such time.
