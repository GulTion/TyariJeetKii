Froggie lives in a lake with lotus leaves numbered from to . Each leaf has a jumping power which allows Froggie to jump from it to another leaf of higher number. Lets say leaf has power , now if Froggie is currently on leaf Froggie will able to jump to any other leaf which has its number within to . Froggie now thinks what is the minimum number of jumps required to jump from some leaf to another. Given queries with numbers and ﬁnd the minimum number of jumps required to reach leaf if Froggie starts from leaf . Input Format First line contains the number of test cases . For every test case: The ﬁrst line contains two integers and . The second line contains integers, the th integer is the value of . The next lines contains two integers and corresponding to the above queries. Constraints Sum of over all test cases does not exceed Sum of over all test cases does not exceed Output Format For every test case print lines where th line has the answer to the th query.
