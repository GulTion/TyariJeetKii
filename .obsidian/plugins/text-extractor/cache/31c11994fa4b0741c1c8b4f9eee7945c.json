Sauron, the Lord of the Rings, aspired to subjugate all of Middle-earth and mold it according to his will. To aid in his quest for dominion, he forged the One Ring, a weapon of immense power.

Now Sauron needs to form a team by choosing one or multple Orcs from this army such that the overall energy of the team is divisible by the size of the team. To defeat Sauron, Aragorn the king needs to know the total number of ways Sauron can form a team modulo . Can you help Aragorn to ﬁnd this number and save Middle-earth? Input Format Input starts with an integer denoting test cases. For each test case, input starts with a integer — the total number of Orc in the army.
