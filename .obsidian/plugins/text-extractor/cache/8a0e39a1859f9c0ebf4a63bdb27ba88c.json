What will you do ? Well, what about you use your power to play with boxes. There are columns of boxes in the room arranged in a line. The -th column contains boxes. At ﬁrst, the gravity in the room is pulling the boxes downwards. When you switch the gravity, it begins to pull all the boxes to the right side of the room. The ﬁgure shows the initial and ﬁnal conﬁgurations of the boxes in the room: the boxes that have changed their position are highlighted with red. Input Format First line will contains . The next line contains space-separated integer numbers. The -th number denotes the number of boxes in the -th column. Constraints 1 ≤   ≤ 10 1 ≤   ≤ 10 Output Format Output integer numbers separated by spaces, where the -th number is the amount of boxes in the -th column after the gravity switch.
