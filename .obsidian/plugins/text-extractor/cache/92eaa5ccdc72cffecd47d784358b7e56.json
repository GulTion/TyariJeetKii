He distributed his ﬁrst assets to Ratul and remaining of the assets to Rahat. You have magic cards each of which can modify the price of any one asset. A magic card is a pair of single-digit numbers which can replace a digit from a price of an asset to the digit . Initially the price of any asset is without any leading zeroes, but it can have leading zeroes after the use of a magic card. You can choose a subset of magic cards from the cards where every from the card pairs must be distinct. Each of the cards from the chosen subset can be used at most once. Also note that you cannot use more than one card on any digit. Read the sample explanation for further clarity. Help Mr. Rakib to reduce the absolute diﬀerence between the two boys' sum of assets by using the magic cards. Input Format The ﬁrst line contains an integer denoting the number of test cases. Then testcases follow. The ﬁrst line of each testcase contains two integers and , where denotes the total number of assets and denotes the number of assets Ratul receives. The second line contains positive integers denoting the price of the assets. The third line contains an integer denoting the number of magic cards. Then lines follow, each containing a pair of integers describing a magic card. Constraints Output Format For each test case print an integer, the minimum absolute diﬀerence after using the magic cards, on a separate line.

The absolute diﬀerence of their sum is now |(2 + 1) - 99| = 96. Note that the card (1, 2) could only be used once on one of Ratul' s assets. Note that the card (2, 3) could not be used to modify the ﬁrst asset after the ﬁrst car d, because you cannot use multiple cards on the same digit. testcase: If you change 3r d asset's price 78' s ﬁrst digit with card (7, 5), then ne w price will be 58. Then change 6th asset 's price 22' s second digit with (2, 5), then ne w price will be 25. Now sum of Ratul assets is 12 + 56 + 58 = 126 and Rahat 's is 90 + 11 + 25 = 126.
