Monzur deﬁnes a triplet interesting if it satisﬁes the following conditions: and Monzur wants to know how many diﬀerent interesting triplets can he ﬁnd in his sequence. Can you help him? Input Format The ﬁrst line of input contains an integer denoting the number of test cases. Then testcases follow. The ﬁrst line of each test case contains an integer — the length of the sequence. The next line contains space separated integers — the sequence. Constraints Output Format For each test case, output a single integer, the number of diﬀerent interesting triplets.
