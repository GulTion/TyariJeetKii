This is a simple question. There will be multiple test-case in a file(1<=test\_case<=10).

You are given a query for each test case. Every query consists two integers n & m(n<=m). You have to answer, how many prime number in between n to m inclusive.

Prime Number is a number that is divisible only by itself and 1 (e.g. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11).

**Input Format**

First line of test case file contains one integer N denoted as test case.

Next N line you are given two integer separated by space(n and m).

**Constraints**

1<=test\_case<=10

1<= n <= m <= 1000000

**Output Format**

Just print how many prime number in between n to m inclusive for every query.

**Sample Input 0**

```
2
1 10
2 5
```

**Sample Output 0**

```
4
3
```
