Suppose there is a R&D institute, that R&D institute faces some security issues. So, it is a top priority of the management to protect its business secrets. Now, the Managing Director (MD) of the R&D institute, came up with a solution. He decided to encrypt his messages with a secret key. The key is "Samsung". To encrypt a message he breaks the keyword into one or more substrings and place them into different positions of the message in the same order as they appear in the keyword. A message from him consists of lowercase or uppercase English words.

Now the MD wants you to find out if the message is from him or a ghost.

**Input Format**

Input contains the message.

**Constraints**

```
1 <= message.size() <= 10000
```

**Output Format**

Print "SRBD" if the message is from the MD, otherwise print "GHOST" in a single line.

**Sample Input 0**

```
Samsung
```

**Sample Output 0**

```
SRBD
```
